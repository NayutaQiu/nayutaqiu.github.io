**2024**

- **Complexity Matters: Dynamics of Feature Learning in the Presence of Spurious Correlations** \
**GuanWen Qiu**, Da Kuang, Surbhi Goel
*ICML 2024* \
*TL:DR*: The presence of a $$\lambda$$ correlated spurious features slows down the learning of core features in a ratio $$4\lambda(1-\lambda)$$.  
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03375)

- **Deep Tree Embedding: Reconstructing Phylogeny with Partial Information and Metric Learning** \
**GuanWen Qiu**, Da Kuang, Junhyong Kim \
*TL:DR*: Metric learning effectively denoises features unrelated to the tree signal. With additional partial information about tree topology, the reconstruction accuracy improves significantly. \
