I am a graduating master’s student at the University of Pennsylvania, pursuing dual majors in Data Science and Computer Science. As I apply for Ph.D. programs for 2025, my research centers on machine learning, with a focus on modern representation learning, model interpretability, and Out Of Distribution Generalization. I am particularly drawn to theory that could deepen our understanding and guide practical applications.

<!-- This website serves as both a personal repository and a place for others interested in machine learning. Here, I will start to continuously document my notes, whether from research or self-study. I hope that some of these reflections may offer fresh perspectives to visitors. -->

When I am not doing research, I enjoy playing fingerstyle guitar, singing, and watching anime. You can find some of my guitar recordings [here](https://space.bilibili.com/28998104). My all-time favorite instrumental is Nayuta by the guitarist [Kotaro Oshio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotaro_Oshio)—check out the [original version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yWJtDhe09M) and [my rendition](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Xi4y1K76t).
